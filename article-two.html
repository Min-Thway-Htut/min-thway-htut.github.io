            In todayâ€™s world, modern innovations (innovative products or devices) are booming at an
            exponential rate in various industries. At this point, people usually misunderstand that being
            innovative means being new or being a pioneer in a particular field. However, there are many
            products which were not even used though they used to be a novelty in the industry. That is why
            it cannot be denied that a successful innovation means the combination of novelty and
            usefulness.

            As long as the internet came to power since the start of 1995, many new and modern
            technologies came into picture and subsequently changed our lifestyles. These technological
            innovations include smartphones, social media, cloud computing, Internet of Things, Artificial
            Intelligence, Blockchain, Near-field Communication and so on.
            Among countless innovations, I chose Near-field Communication also known as NFC
            technology and NFC chips as an innovative product for the final assignment.

            NFC technology was officially invented in 1983 by Charles Walton. After his invention, in 2002,
            Sony and Philips co-invented NFC and the International Organization for Standardization
            approved it as a standard in 2003. Later on, the very first NFC tags were created and started to
            be used in Nokia 6131 in 2006. Then, Samsaung and Visa developed a mobile payment system
            using NFC technology in 2013. For now, NFC technology has become very popular and has
            been widely used in various industries.(Paragon ID, no date
